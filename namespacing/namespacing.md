Namespaces
==========
Namespaces can be found in almost any serious JavaScript application. Unless we're working with a simple code-snippet, it's imperative that we do our best to ensure that we're implementing namespacing correctly as it's not just simple to pick-up, it'll also avoid third party code clobbering our own. The patterns we'll be examining in this section are:

- Automated nested
- Immediately-invoked Function Expressions (IIFE)
- Injection
- Object literal notation
- Nested namespacing
- Prefix
- Single global variables
